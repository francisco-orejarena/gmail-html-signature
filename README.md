# e-mail Signature for Master's Program e-mail

In my search for an appropriate and professional looking e-mail signature, 
I found that it was quite difficult to deal with making it in Google Docs, 
or Sheets, or any other application that was not as purely programmable,
or overall as customizable as html is. This was inspired by another repo
I encountered that had created an html save file for himself.
